# Lessons Learned (Living Document)

**Purpose:** Capture project learnings across all sprints with complete implementation tracking.

**Last Updated:** [Update date when lessons are added]

---

## How This Document Works

This is a **LIVING DOCUMENT** that grows with each sprint. It captures:

- **WHAT** we learned from each sprint
- **WHERE** each lesson was implemented (code/tests/docs/skills/commands/scripts)
- **HOW** implementations work (specific file paths and patterns)
- **STATUS** of implementation (✅ PROCESSED = fully implemented, no action needed)
- **TRACEABILITY** back to the sprint where discovered

### Status Legend

- ✅ **PROCESSED** - Fully implemented and documented. No further action needed.
- ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Partially implemented. Ongoing work or deferred items.
- ❌ **TODO** - Identified but not yet implemented. Tracked for future sprints.

### How to Use This Document

1. **Before starting new features:** Review relevant categories for patterns and anti-patterns
2. **During code reviews:** Reference lessons for context on why we follow certain patterns
3. **Sprint planning:** Check TODO items for technical debt to address
4. **Onboarding:** Use as learning resource for new team members

- [Architecture Patterns](#architecture-patterns)
- [Test Quality](#test-quality)
- [Tooling Improvements](#tooling-improvements)
- [Process Improvements](#process-improvements)
- [Time Estimation](#time-estimation)
- [Import Rules & Common Errors](#import-rules--common-errors)
- [Anti-Patterns](#anti-patterns)

## Lesson Template

Use this template when adding new lessons:

### Lesson: [Descriptive Title]

**Discovered in:** Sprint X (Context/Worktree, specific activity)

**What we learned:**
[Describe the problem, discovery, or insight in 2-3 sentences]

**Solution:**
[Bullet points describing the approach taken]

**Implementation:**

- ✅/⚠️/❌ **Code:** [File paths where implemented]
- ✅/⚠️/❌ **Tests:** [Test files that verify the pattern]
- ✅/⚠️/❌ **Docs:** [Documentation files that explain it]
- ✅/⚠️/❌ **Skills:** [Skill files that capture the pattern]
- ✅/⚠️/❌ **Commands:** [Command files that automate it]
- ✅/⚠️/❌ **Scripts:** [Script files that implement it]
- ✅/⚠️/❌ **CLAUDE.md:** [Sections in CLAUDE.md that reference it]

**Status:** ✅ PROCESSED / ⚠️ PARTIAL / ❌ TODO
**Sprint:** X
